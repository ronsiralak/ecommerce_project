Models (models.py):
Define the structure of your database, including tables for products, categories, users, orders, etc. This is the foundation of your project's data.

Views (views.py):
Implement the logic for rendering pages and handling user interactions. Views are responsible for fetching data from the database, processing forms, and rendering templates.

URL Configuration (urls.py):
Define the URL patterns that map to your views. This is how users access different parts of your website.

Templates (templates/):
Store HTML templates that define the layout and structure of your website's pages. Templates are dynamically populated with data from views.

Static Files (static/):
Keep static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images here. These files define the appearance and behavior of your website.

Settings (settings.py):
Configure your project's settings, including database configuration, security settings, installed apps, and more.

Admin (admin.py):
Customize the Django admin panel to manage your e-commerce site's data through an intuitive interface.

Forms (forms.py):
Define forms for user input and validation, such as user registration, login, checkout, and more.

User Authentication (django.contrib.auth):
Utilize Django's built-in authentication system for user registration, login, and handling user sessions.

Middleware (middleware.py):
Implement middleware to add functionality that operates on the request/response globally, such as authentication checks, security features, etc.

Pip Requirements (requirements.txt):
List all the dependencies (Django and other packages) that your project relies on. This ensures consistent installations across environments.

Database Migrations (migrations/):
Store the migration files generated by Django whenever you make changes to your models. Migrations update the database schema as your models evolve.

Testing (tests.py):
Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure your project's functionality works as expected and to catch regressions.

Deployment Configuration:
If deploying to a production environment, you might have configuration files for the web server (e.g., Nginx), application server (e.g., Gunicorn), and settings specific to your hosting provider.

Project Structure:
Maintain a well-organized directory structure where each app in your project encapsulates related functionality.
